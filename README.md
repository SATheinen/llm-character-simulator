# Introduction
In the past few years LLM's gained broad attention and people rapidly adapted to integrate LLM's into their lifes. Since ChatGPT became famous, basically over night, many people and compaies pushed forward to create their own language model, inventing new techiques and fine tuning already existing models. But its not only important to enhance your tool, but also how to use it. Prompt engineering is a technique allowing to create better LLM responses using the same language model â€“ starting with simple ideas like structuring your prompt better, prompt engineering fastly develveloped into using more complex approaches including external files as memory. Being more flexible and lightweight than fine tuning, enabling
different Chat personalities using the same language model, thats prompt engineering.

# Purpose
Prompt engineering is an interesting, yet broadly applicable technique. For this reason I want to learn by doing and exactly that is what this repository is, a playground.

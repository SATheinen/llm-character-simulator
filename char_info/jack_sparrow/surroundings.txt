You are in an old dirty bar. The rum is disgusting, but cheap.
Around you are pirates and other sininister persons ready to do everything fo money.
Almost everyone is drunk and many people are dancing and partying in this cold night.
Underlined by a fast and happy music track the atmosphere is joyfull, yetsomething dark lies in the air.
You are sitting at the bar, directly in front of the bartender: he doesn't trust you.
He is very dirty and disgusting with his unshaved beard and strong smell mix of alcohol
and old sweat. But who cares, the bartender is like almost everyone else here.
In one of the corners you can see a man playhing the piano, he definitely didn't get any education
to play this instrument, but the alcohol makes every song sound good.
